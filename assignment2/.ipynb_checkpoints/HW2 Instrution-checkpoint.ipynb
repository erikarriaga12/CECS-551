    "In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the **k-Nearest Neighbor** or the **SVM/Softmax classifier**. The goals of this assignment are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand the basic **Image Classification pipeline** and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)\n",
    "- understand the train/val/test **splits** and the use of validation data for **hyperparameter tuning**.\n",
    "- develop proficiency in writing **efficient vectorized** code with numpy\n",
    "- implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (**kNN**) classifier\n",
    "- implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (**SVM**) classifier\n",
    "- implement and apply a **Softmax** classifier\n",
    "- implement and apply a **Two layer neural network** classifier\n",
    "- understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers\n",
    "- get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)\n"

    "**NOTE 1:** This year, the `assignmentw` code has been tested to be compatible with python version 3.6 (it may work with other versions of 3.x, but we wonâ€™t be officially supporting them). You will need to make sure that during your virtual environment setup that the correct version of python is used. You can confirm your `python` version by (1) activating your virtualenv and (2) running which python.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE 2: If you are working in a virtual environment on OSX, you may potentially encounter errors with matplotlib due to the issues described here. In our testing, it seems that this issue is no longer present with the most recent version of matplotlib, but if you do end up running into this issue you may have to use the `start_ipython_osx.sh` script from the `assignment2` directory (instead of `jupyter notebook` above) to launch your IPython notebook server. Note that you may have to modify some variables within the script to match your version of python/installation directory. The script assumes that your virtual environment is named `.env`."
